# Example Simulations

The files in this folder are Jupyter notebooks saved with [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
These files test for correct behavior and serve as examples.
The simulations included demonstrate simple textbook behavior or reproduce published results.
1. Demonstrate correct group velocity and group velocity dispersion behavior
2. Demonstrate correct third order disperion behavior
3. Demonstrate existence of solitons where they are expected
4. Demonstrate correctness of Green's functions
5. Reproduce the appendix results of [Hosaka et al. 2016 Physical Review A](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.053833)
6. Reproduce the figures in [Lvovsky et al. 2007 Journal of Modern Optics](https://doi.org/10.1080/09500340600777805)
7. Reproduce the figures in [Wasilewski et al. 2006 Physical Review A](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.063819)
8. Demonstrate the theoretical results derived in [Shirasaki, Haus 1990 JOSA B](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.7.000030) 
9. Reproduce the figures in [Doerr et al. 1994 JOSA B](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.11.000143)
10. Demonstrate explicit quasi-phase matching in a simulation, and show the need for high resolution when including domain poling.
11. Reproduce the results of [Suchowski et al. 2008 Physical Review A](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.78.063821)
